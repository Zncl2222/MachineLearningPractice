# Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains my personal practice work in the fields of deep
learning and machine learning. It serves as a centralized location for
storing and documenting my learning journey in these exciting domains.

> **Notice:** This repository is not going to set up a CI, testing, or any other static type checking, as it is solely intended as a place to store practice work.
